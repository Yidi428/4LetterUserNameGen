Username Generator
This Python script generates random 4-letter pronounceable usernames. You can customize whether certain letters are replaced with numbers.

How It Works
The script selects consonants and vowels to create a pronounceable username.
The first two letters are a consonant followed by a vowel.
The last two letters can be either consonant-consonant or vowel-consonant.
Optionally, certain letters (like “a,” “e,” “i,” “o,” or “b”) can be replaced with random numbers.
Usage
Install Python 3.
Install the necessary libraries using pip:
pip install pyperclip

Run the script:
python username_generator.py

Dependencies
Python 3
pyperclip library (for copying the generated username to the clipboard)
