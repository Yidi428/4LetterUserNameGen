# Username Generator

This Python script generates random 4-letter pronounceable usernames. You can customize whether certain letters are replaced with numbers.

## How It Works

1. The script selects consonants and vowels to create a pronounceable username.
2. The first two letters are a consonant followed by a vowel.
3. The last two letters can be either consonant-consonant or vowel-consonant.
4. Optionally, certain letters (like "a," "e," "i," "o," or "b") can be replaced with random numbers.

## Usage

1. **Install Python 3**.
2. **Install the necessary libraries using pip**:
    ```
    pip install pyperclip
    ```
3. **Run the script**:
    ```
    python username_generator.py
    ```

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- `pyperclip` library (for copying the generated username to the clipboard)

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the repository folder.
3. Execute the script using `python username_generator.py`.

Feel free to modify and enhance this script as needed!
